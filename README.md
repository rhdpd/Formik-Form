# Formik-Form

Formik is a small library that can help with the three most annoying aspects of creating forms in React:

 Getting values in and out of the form state
 Validation and error messages
 Handling form submission
By collecting all of the above in one place, Formik can keep things organized, making testing, refactoring, and reasoning your forms much easier
